### Bonus Features Implemented

#### 1. Undo/Redo System

Our robust [undo/redo system](docs/UNDO_REDO_FLOW_README.md) supports:

- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + Z for undo, Ctrl/Cmd + Y for redo)
- Up to 50 history states
- Visual feedback through notifications
- Comprehensive action tracking (create, update, delete)

#### 2. Kanban Board View

The [Kanban implementation](docs/KANBAN_FLOW_README.md) offers:

- Priority-based columns (Urgent, High, Medium, Low, None)
- Drag-and-drop task management
- Column-specific sorting and filtering
- Independent column configurations

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### State Management

- Custom `useHistory` hook for undo/redo functionality
- Local state management using React hooks
- Efficient state updates with optimized renders

### Component Architecture

- Container/Presentation pattern for separation of concerns
- Reusable components with clear interfaces
- Modular CSS with scoped styling

### Data Flow

- Unidirectional data flow
- Event-driven architecture for user interactions
- Optimized rendering with React.memo and useMemo

## Testing

### Test Setup

The project includes a comprehensive test setup with Jest and React Testing Library:

- **Test Environment**: JSDOM
- **Setup File**: `jest.setup.ts` includes mocks for:
  - IntersectionObserver
  - ResizeObserver
  - Next.js navigation
  - Mantine notifications
  - localStorage
  - window.matchMedia

### Test Utilities

Custom test utilities (`test-utils.tsx`) provide:

- Wrapped render function with Mantine providers
- Custom selectors and user interactions
- Mantine component configurations for testing

### Example Tests

Tests are written using React Testing Library with a focus on user interactions. For example, the CustomFieldsManager tests demonstrate:

- Field name validation
- Duplicate field prevention
- Successful field addition
- Integration with Mantine UI components

## Getting Started

### Node Version

This project uses Node.js version 21.6.2. To ensure you're using the correct version:

1. Make sure you have [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed
2. Run the following command in the project root:

   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

   This will automatically switch to Node.js 21.6.2 as specified in the `.nvmrc` file.

3. Clone the repository
4. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
or
yarn install
or
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
or
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Design Decisions & Assumptions

### Design Decisions

1. **Hybrid View System**: Implemented both table and Kanban views to accommodate different user preferences and workflows

2. **Local Storage**: Chose browser local storage for data persistence

3. **Custom Fields Implementation**: Built a flexible schema system that:

   - Maintains backward compatibility
   - Supports different data types
   - Preserves existing task data

   ## Performance Optimizations

This project implements several advanced performance optimization techniques to ensure optimal loading times and efficient resource utilization:

### 1. Code Splitting & Dynamic Imports

- Implemented intelligent code splitting using Next.js dynamic imports
- Lazy load components that aren't needed for initial render:
  ```typescript
  const TaskForm = dynamic(
    () => import("../TaskForm/TaskForm").then((mod) => mod.TaskForm),
    { ssr: false }
  );
  ```
- Components like TaskTable and KanbanBoard are loaded on demand, reducing initial bundle size

### 2. Bundle Optimization

- Configured advanced Webpack optimizations for production builds:
  - Tree shaking enabled for removing unused code
  - Chunk splitting strategy implemented with optimal size limits (20KB - 244KB)
  - Separate chunks for framework code (React, Next.js)
  - Vendor code splitting for better caching
  ```typescript
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
      minSize: 20000,
      maxSize: 244000,
      // ... optimized caching groups
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Package Optimizations

- Implemented selective imports for UI libraries
- Optimized package imports for:
  - @mantine/core
  - @mantine/hooks
  - @tabler/icons-react
- Configured experimental CSS optimization

### 4. Build-time Optimizations

- Enabled production-specific optimizations:
  - Console statements removed in production
  - Dead code elimination
  - Optimized CSS delivery using Critters
- Implemented bundle analysis for continuous optimization:
  ```bash
  npm run analyze   # Visualize bundle composition
  ```

### 5. Runtime Performance

- Implemented efficient state management
- Optimized re-renders using React.memo and useMemo where appropriate
- Configured proper caching strategies

### 6. Monitoring & Analysis

- Bundle analyzer integration for size monitoring
- Chunk splitting visualization
- Performance metrics tracking

### 7. Development Workflow

- Development builds maintain source maps for debugging
- Production builds are fully optimized for performance
- Cross-environment consistency maintained using cross-env

### Assumptions

1. **Browser Support**: Optimized for modern browsers with local storage support
2. **Data Volume**: Designed to handle hundreds of tasks efficiently in the browser
3. **User Preferences**: Users prefer immediate feedback and quick interactions
